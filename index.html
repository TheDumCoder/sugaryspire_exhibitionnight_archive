          <p>â€…Hailing from a small rural town east of Avignon, France, the Painter understood ever since he was a boy that the country life was not for him. After his physical prowess earned him an athletic scolarship abroad, the Painter chose to become a student of the arts, and his career as an artist began in earnest. While many of his earliest works such as "Painter Wuz Here" and "I Hate 'The Man'" were lost forever after being destroyed by campus police, the undercurrent of rebellion they represented would come to define the Painter's unique artistic voice. After submitting a work titled "I Dislike Politicians in General for Numerous Reasons" to the city newspaper, Painter was given a job as the paper's resident satirist, where his thought provoking social commentary quickly gained a following with other free thinkers. Still, the Painter always aspired to make his mark in the world of "High Art," to create paintings worthy of being displayed in fancy museums next to Van Gogh and Picasso. After almost a year of work, the Painter is finally ready to share his true artistic talent with the world.</p>
